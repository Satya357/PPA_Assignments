Q5.What is the use of interface in Java?

Ans - The use of interfaces in Java is to define a set of methods that classes implementing the interface must have. It ensures consistent behavior among different classes and enables code to work with objects of different classes that implement the same interface. Interfaces also allow a class to implement multiple interfaces, providing a form of multiple inheritance. Additionally, interfaces facilitate API design by defining contracts that clients can use.

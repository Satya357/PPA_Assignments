Q8.What is the functional interface in Java 8?

Ans - In Java 8, a functional interface is an interface that has exactly one abstract method. It serves as the foundation for lambda expressions and method references. Functional interfaces enable the use of functional programming concepts in Java and allow behavior to be treated as a first-class citizen. They promote a more concise and expressive coding style, making code easier to read and maintain. The @FunctionalInterface annotation is used to explicitly designate an interface as functional, ensuring it has only one abstract method.

Q9.What is the benefit of lambda expressions in Java 8?

Ans - Lambda expressions in Java 8 provide shorter and more expressive code, making it easier to write and understand. They promote functional programming by treating behavior as a first-class citizen, allowing developers to write code in a more concise and declarative manner. Lambda expressions simplify the use of functional interfaces, making it convenient to work with collections, streams, and APIs. They also enable efficient parallel processing, enhancing performance on multicore processors. Overall, lambda expressions bring simplicity, expressiveness, and performance improvements to Java programming.

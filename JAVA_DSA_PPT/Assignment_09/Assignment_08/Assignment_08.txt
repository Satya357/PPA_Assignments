Q1. What is ORM in Hibernate?
Ans. ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) in Hibernate is a technique that maps Java objects to database tables, allowing developers to work with objects instead of writing complex SQL queries. Hibernate provides an ORM framework that automates the mapping process and simplifies database operations.

Q2. What are the advantages of Hibernate over JDBC?
Ans. Hibernate offers several advantages over JDBC, including automatic object-relational mapping, reduced boilerplate code, improved productivity, database independence, caching mechanisms, and support for object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance and polymorphism.

Q3. What are some of the important interfaces of the Hibernate framework?
Ans. Some important interfaces in Hibernate include SessionFactory, Session, Transaction, Query, and Criteria. SessionFactory represents a factory for creating Session objects, Session represents a single-threaded context for performing database operations, Transaction manages database transactions, Query allows executing HQL (Hibernate Query Language) queries, and Criteria provides a programmatic way to define and execute database queries.

Q4. What is a Session in Hibernate?
Ans. In Hibernate, a Session represents a single-threaded context for performing database operations. It provides methods for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, querying the database, managing transactions, and accessing caching mechanisms. A Session acts as an interface between the application and the database, allowing developers to perform database operations using Hibernate APIs.

Q5. What is a SessionFactory?
Ans. A SessionFactory in Hibernate is a thread-safe object that represents a factory for creating Session objects. It is responsible for initializing Hibernate configuration, mapping files, and providing a shared connection pool. The SessionFactory is typically created once during application startup and is used to create multiple Session objects throughout the application's lifecycle.

Q6. What is HQL?
Ans. HQL (Hibernate Query Language) is a powerful object-oriented query language provided by Hibernate. It is similar to SQL but operates on Java objects instead of database tables. HQL allows developers to express database queries using object-oriented concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and associations between entities. HQL queries are translated into SQL queries by Hibernate and executed on the underlying database.

Q7. What are Many-to-Many associations?
Ans. Many-to-Many associations in Hibernate represent a relationship between two entities where multiple instances of one entity are associated with multiple instances of another entity. This type of association is typically implemented using a join table that maps the relationships between the two entities. Hibernate provides mechanisms to handle Many-to-Many associations, including cascading operations, fetching strategies, and bidirectional mappings.

Q8. What is Hibernate caching?
Ans. Hibernate caching is a mechanism that improves the performance of database operations by storing frequently accessed data in memory. Hibernate provides two levels of caching: the first level cache (session cache) is associated with a Session and stores objects retrieved during the current session, while the second level cache (session factory cache) is shared among multiple sessions and stores data that can be reused across sessions.

Q9. What is the difference between the first level cache and the second level cache?
Ans. The first level cache, also known as the session cache, is associated with a Session in Hibernate. It is enabled by default and stores objects retrieved during the current session. The first level cache ensures that multiple requests for the same object within a session are served from memory, reducing database round trips. On the other hand, the second level cache is a shared cache that stores data across multiple sessions. It improves performance by caching data that can be reused across sessions, reducing the need to fetch data from the database repeatedly.

Q10. What can you tell about the Hibernate Configuration File?
Ans. The Hibernate Configuration File is an XML file that contains the configuration settings for Hibernate. It specifies the database connection details, mapping files or annotated classes, and other settings required by Hibernate. The Configuration File is used to initialize the SessionFactory, which is responsible for creating Session objects. It provides flexibility in configuring Hibernate's behavior, such as defining the database dialect, enabling caching, setting connection properties, and configuring various mapping options.

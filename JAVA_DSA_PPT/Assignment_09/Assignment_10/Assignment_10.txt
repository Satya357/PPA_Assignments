Q1. What is the Spring MVC framework?
Ans. The Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework is a part of the Spring Framework that provides support for building web applications based on the MVC design pattern. It offers features for handling client requests, mapping them to appropriate handlers, and generating responses using views.

Q2. What are the benefits of the Spring MVC framework over other MVC frameworks?
Ans. The Spring MVC framework provides benefits such as flexible configuration, integration with other Spring components, support for testing, separation of concerns, extensibility, and a large community and ecosystem.

Q3. What is DispatcherServlet in Spring MVC? Can you explain the Spring MVC architecture?
Ans. The DispatcherServlet is the front controller in the Spring MVC framework. It receives all incoming requests and delegates them to appropriate handler components based on mappings defined in the configuration. The Spring MVC architecture follows the MVC design pattern, where the DispatcherServlet acts as the controller, models represent the application data, and views handle the presentation logic.

Q4. What is a View Resolver pattern and explain its significance in Spring MVC?
Ans. The View Resolver pattern is used in Spring MVC to determine the appropriate view to render for a response. It resolves logical view names to actual view implementations based on predefined rules or configurations. The View Resolver pattern allows flexibility in changing views without modifying the controller logic.

Q5. What are the differences between @RequestParam and @PathVariable annotations?
Ans. The @RequestParam annotation is used to extract query parameters or form data from the request URL, while the @PathVariable annotation is used to extract path variables from the request URL. @RequestParam is used with query parameters like "?name=value", while @PathVariable is used with path variables like "/users/{id}".

Q6. What is the Model in Spring MVC?
Ans. In Spring MVC, the Model represents the application data that is passed between the controller and the view. It encapsulates the data required for rendering the view and supports data binding and validation.

Q7. What is the role of @ModelAttribute annotation?
Ans. The @ModelAttribute annotation is used to bind request parameters or form data to a model object. It binds the data sent from the client to the model object, making it available in the controller methods for processing.

Q8. What is the significance of @Repository annotation?
Ans. The @Repository annotation is used to indicate that a class is a repository, typically for database access or data manipulation. It is a specialization of the @Component annotation and allows for automatic bean detection and configuration in Spring.

Q9. What does REST stand for? What are RESTful web services?
Ans. REST stands for Representational State Transfer. RESTful web services are architectural principles for designing networked applications. They use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources represented by URLs. RESTful web services promote scalability, simplicity, and interoperability between systems.

Q10. What are the differences between RESTful web services and SOAP web services?
Ans. RESTful web services are lightweight, use simple protocols like HTTP, and typically return data in lightweight formats like JSON or XML. They are stateless and follow the principles of REST. On the other hand, SOAP web services are based on the SOAP protocol, use XML for data representation, and provide features like security and reliability. SOAP web services are more heavyweight and require additional configuration and tooling.
